## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
 The purpose of this analysis is to pull employee data and analyze it for a possible large wave of retirements. Also, for a potential eligibility into a mentorship program.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
 - Retirement is not manadtory; these only list the count of employees per title that are eligible. To make an impact during this wave of potential retirements, let's say, 50,000 roles may need to re-filled. This is a rough estimate.
 
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- Sure, we are confident the next generation is ready and able to support these open positions and the numbers in our analyses support such a claim.
